## 2011 Area Classification for Output Areas (2011 Output Area Classification or 2011 OAC)
The 2011 OAC has been created through collaboration between the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and University College London (UCL). The 2011 OAC is a three-tiered hierarchical geodemographic classification of the UK built using only 2011 UK Census data at the Output Area / Small Area level. It consists of 8 Supergroups, 26 Groups and 76 Subgroups. 

A number of 2011 OAC resources are available on the [ONS webpage](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/geography/products/area-classifications/ns-area-classifications/ns-2011-area-classifications/index.html) and [Open Geodemographics](http://http://www.opengeodemographics.com/)

This webpage is designed to provide additional material and information to aid use of the 2011 OAC. The following resources are available:

**The cartogram representations have had the size and shape of each Output Area and Small Area modified based on the resident population on the 27th March 2011

*** Please note instead of each Output Area or Small Area being assigned to one distinct Supergroup, they are given values representing how similar they are to all eight Supergroups. The lower the number, the higher the similarity that Output Area or Small Area has to the characteristics described in the Pen Portraits. 

**** Please note these maps should not be interpreted as having a higher level of precision than a standard choropleth map of Output Areas and Small Areas. The colour of an individual building is derived from the average of the Output Area or Small Area it is located in, and is not a reflection of that particular property itself.
